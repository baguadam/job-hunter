# Job Hunter
## About
This repository contains the implementation of the final programming project for the Client-side Web Programming course, part of the Computer Science BSc program at ELTE. The REST API was provided, and the main task was to develop the front-end of the "Job Hunter" application using React, Redux, and RTK Query.

## Tasks
The application must manage login and registration with different roles: users can register as either a **jobseeker** or a **company**.
* Jobseeker: Users can view all available jobs, filter and search through them, and apply for any position. The profile page displays the user's full details and previous experiences.
* Company: Users can post new jobs, edit previously posted advertisements, delete them, and see the applicants for each position.
